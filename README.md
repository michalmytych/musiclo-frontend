# musiclo-frontend

Frontend for [musiclo](https://wierzba.wzks.uj.edu.pl/~19_mytych/projekt/music-database/) webservice, which I created for my Databases 2 classes at University.

### Features & solutions:
* Genius API integration & lyrics automatic search
* Charts using CanvasJS for React
* React Infinite Scroller
* Basic components tests with Jest
* Dynamic searching in categories
* Embedded Spotify player
* Simple search on YouTube

```bash
# You can run it locally, but requests at production server are not possible
# so application views won't be filled with data

git clone https://github.com/michalmytych/musiclo-frontend.git

cd musiclo-frontend

npm install

npm start

```
